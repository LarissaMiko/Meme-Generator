# OMM - Meme Generator - Final Project

With the meme generator you can select an image out of a slideshow and add a top-caption and a bottom-caption.
Once you're happy with the result you can upload the meme to the database in the backend. The meme-url and the two captions are saved there.
The slideshow also retrieves the pictures from the database

### Start the project locally

Start the server:

```
npm start
```

Start React-frontend:

change into folder and run

```
npm start
```

TODO: Run tests:

```
npm test
```

Full documentation of the frontend can be found in the README in the frontend folder.

## Meme Generator - Backend

The Backend of the meme generator consists of an express server `server.js` and a MongoDB database.

### Express Server

The Express server connects the React frontend and the Database with an API that provides the following endpoints:

#### Memes and meme-templates

- Get image-templates from database : `GET /images`
- Get saved memes from database (for Meme-Gallery) : `GET /memes`
- Download a list of memes as zip-file: `GET /download`
- Post new meme to database (for Meme-Gallery) : `POST /memes`
- Get saved meme by id: `GET /memes/:id`
- Get memes generated by specific user: `GET /memes/users/:id`
- Set CORS Header for remote sources (neccesary when user wants to upload own meme-templates): `GET /proxy`

#### Authentication

- Create new account-credentials to database -> return login-token or error: `POST /auth/signup`
- Authenticate existing user -> return login-token or error: `GET /auth/signup`

#### User interaction

- Get comments for a meme by memeid: `GET /comments/:id`
- Post new comment to a meme by memeid: `POST /comments/:id`
- Handle new vote, account-bound if userid provided in parameters: `PUT /vote`
- Count meme-views: `PUT /views`

#### Statistics

- Get statistical data: `GET /statistics`
- Post statistical data: `POST /statistics`

## Database

All relevant data for the Meme-Generator is stored in a MongoDB database with the following collections:

- **memes**: Collection of all meme-templates that are provided by the Meme-Generator internally
- **meme-gallery**: Collection of all user-created memes
- **users**: Collection of all users with email, name and password
- **statistics**: Collection of statistical data from template selection and meme-generation
